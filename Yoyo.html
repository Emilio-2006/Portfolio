        <h2>Welcome To My Yoyo Page</h2>
        <p> Welcome to the yo-yo page here one the yo-yo page you can see some yo-yos these yo-yo are the yo-yos that i own well i currently own the blue and pink one and the orange and pink one the green one broke.
            But if you are into yo-yos just like me and you want a better yo-yo than a cheap 1 dollar yo-yo you should go for this yo-yo here at the bottom called the arrow this yo-yo can be switched into 2 different modes.
            One which you are familiar with which is a responsive side of the yo-yo which is used for simple tricks like rock the cradle or walk the dog
            and the yo-yo comes back up with a simple tug. But with the other yo-yos which are called godspeed and Dna those 2 yo-yos are called unresponsive
            yoyos which are yo-yos made for intermediate yo-yo users which are made for advanced tricks and the yo-yo does not come back to you with a simple tug.
            You would have to do a trick called a bind and it would wrap the yo-yo back up into your hand just be ready to catch the yo-yo.</p>
