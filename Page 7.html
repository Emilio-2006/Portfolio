    Welcome to the card tricks page here i will talk about cards and their tricks. So for starters with the package you will get a brand new deck of cards and when you open the deck of cards you will see in the middle of the cards the 2 kings will be together people who use cards call this the kissing kâ€™s or kissing kings. There are tricks you can play on people that are not really magic tricks but you can use mind trigery and trick and confuse peoples minds and make them believe you did a actual magic tricks. There is more to cards but i would suggest looking it up on youtube because i am not good at giving advice for card tricks i would suggest you observe and learn.
